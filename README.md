___

### Requirements
First, you'll want to create an app on [Twitter](https://apps.twitter.com) if you haven't. This will allow you have the necessary credentials for authentication.

___

### Installation
To run the program, you need to have Python installed on your machine.
Follow this [link]("https://python.org") to download Python.

Next...
Clone this repo and move into the project directory. <br>

_NB_: _Make sure you have **virtualenv** installed._ Click [here](https://gist.github.com/frfahim/73c0fad6350332cef7a653bcd762f08d) to see how you can set it up.<br>
Open your `terminal` or `command prompt`  and run: <br>
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to install all required packages. If everything works well, move on!

### Finally...let's run the program
* Rename the file `twitter_credentials.example.py` to `twitter_credentials.py`
* Open the file and input your API credentials.

In the command line, enter:
```
python tweepy_streamer.py
```
and voila! WE ARE LIVE. ðŸ’ƒðŸ’ƒðŸ’ƒ
